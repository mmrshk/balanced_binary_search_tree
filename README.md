# Counting Sort in Ruby

When Counting Sort Doesn't Perform Well
Counting Sort is highly efficient for specific scenarios, but there are cases where it doesn't perform well:
Large Range of Elements: 
When the range of the input numbers is significantly larger than the number of elements to be sorted. 
Counting Sort requires an array of size proportional to the range of the numbers, leading to high memory usage.
